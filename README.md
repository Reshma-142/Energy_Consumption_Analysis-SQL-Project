# Energy Consumption Analysis - SQL Project

This project focuses on analyzing global energy trends—including emissions, production, consumption, GDP, and population—using a structured MySQL database. The goal is to understand how different countries contribute to global energy use and emissions, identify key patterns, and generate meaningful insights for sustainable development and energy planning.

## Key Components

### **1. Database Design**

* Designed a structured schema with relational tables for country, emissions, GDP, population, production, and consumption.
* Implemented foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity.
* Used MySQL Workbench for schema design and query execution.

### **2. SQL Analysis**

Executed **18+ analytical SQL queries** including:

* Total emissions by country
* GDP ranking for latest year
* Energy production vs. consumption comparison
* Emission trends over time
* Population-emission relationship
* Per-capita and ratio analysis (emission-to-GDP, consumption per capita, etc.)
* Global share of emissions
* Countries showing improvements or decline over the last decade

These queries reveal how different energy types contribute to overall emissions and how economic and demographic factors drive global trends.

### **3. Trend & Ratio Analysis**

* Year-over-year emissions tracking
* GDP growth evaluation
* Population impact on emissions
* Per-capita consumption and production indicators
* Sustainability metrics for long-term comparison

##  Key Insights

* Major economies lead in both GDP and emissions, highlighting their responsibility to adopt cleaner energy systems.
* Significant disparities exist in per-capita emissions, indicating differences in lifestyle, efficiency, and energy access.
* Energy demand continues to rise, emphasizing the need for balanced production–consumption strategies.
* Emission-to-GDP ratios show which countries generate more emissions relative to economic output.
* Renewable adoption and efficient energy management are crucial for long-term sustainability.

##  Tools & Technologies

* **MySQL Workbench**
* **SQL (DDL, DQL, Joins, Aggregations, Ratio Analysis)**

##  Conclusion

This analysis highlights the strong link between economic activity, population growth, and energy-driven emissions. By examining global trends with SQL-based insights, the project provides a clear understanding of where energy efficiency improvements and sustainable policies are most needed.
